        <p>When asked if any studies has examined whether chia seeds could reduce constipation, the experts said they weren’t aware of any. 
            But there’s good research in general showing that dietary fiber — an essential nutrient abundant in chia seeds — can

            more than twice the amount in a medium Red Delicious apple, and a good portion of the
            recommended 21 to 38 grams most people should eat each day.</p>
